1. Implemented make check in the Makefile by checking that the output of
   ./randall 100 is of length 100 bytes, and printing out an error message
   if the output of randall is not equal to the correct size.
2. Split output.c and output.h from the original randall.c file to include
   the writebytes function. Placed function prototype and header guards
   into output.h as well as the required include files. Tested by linking
   randall.c and output.c using gcc to see if randall would execute correctly.
3. Split rand64-hw.c rand64-hw.h from randall.c to include the cpuid struct
   and the cpuid, rdrand_supported, hardware_rand64_init, hardware_rand64,
   and hardware_rand64_fini functions.
4. Split rand64-sw.c rand64-sw.h from randall.c to include urandstream and
   the software_rand64_init, software_rand64, and software_rand64_fini
   functions.
5. Split options.c options.h from randall.c to include
