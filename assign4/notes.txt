Laboratory A: Exploring a linear development history
1. Use Github two-dot diff comparison to compare most recent commits
   (git log): https://github.com/eggert/tz/compare/a47ef9c..48e68f
2. Use Github compare tags function to compare between 2020c and 2020d:
   https://github.com/eggert/tz/compare/2020c...2020d
3. Use git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz
4. Save the hash codes for the current and previous commits to variables
   by using "git rev-parse --short HEAD" and "git rev-parse --short HEAD~1"
   Run git diff on the two hash codes and print to standard output.
5. Run git diff on the first and second arguments ($1 and $2) which should
   be the tags (releases). Print to standard output with cat.
6. Multiple steps to writing this shell script:
   1. Use grep to filter out all lines that don't start with "Date"
   2. Use cut to select the 9th field (only timezone)
   3. Sort the resulting timezones in ascending order
   4. Use uniq -c to only display unique lines and their occurances
   5. Use awk to reverse the order of fields (columns) on each line and
      print out to standard output.
7. Multiple steps to this investigation:
  1. Use git grep to locate the sentence within the file northamerica at 
     line 890:
     git grep -n 'Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.'
  2. Use git blame to traverse the history of line 890 within northamerica:
     git blame -L 890 northamerica
  3. Found that the sentence was added on 2013-09-02 at 08:09:06 -0700 by
     Paul Eggert (commit c8f960ec). The full commit includes:
     'and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."'
